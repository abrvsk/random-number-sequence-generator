# random-number-sequence-generator

Generate randomised sequence from N to K (provided on input).

I've spent 15 minutes trying to figure out a true random algorithm for this task. And although the solution I came up with was cool and recursive and had bells and wistles, it did not provide true randomness. So I've googled the options and 3 hours later I've made my choice. As a basis I'm using [Knuth-Fisher-Yates algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherâ€“Yates_shuffle) of true un-biased randomiser with an amazing complexity of O(n).
